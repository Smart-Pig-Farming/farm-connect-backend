# Security Documentation

## Email Service Security Improvements

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Email Credentials

- **Issue**: The email service had hardcoded fallback credentials (`piggydata25@gmail.com`) which posed a security risk
- **Solution**: Removed all hardcoded email credentials and now require proper environment variable configuration

### 2. Environment Variable Validation

- **Feature**: Added strict validation in the constructor to ensure required email environment variables are set
- **Benefit**: Application will fail fast with a clear error message if email configuration is missing

### 3. Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set for the email service to work:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
```

### 4. Additional Security Features

- **Configuration Check**: Added `isConfigured()` method to check if email service is properly configured
- **Connection Verification**: Added `verifyConnection()` method to test email service connectivity
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with clear error messages

## Admin User Security Improvements

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Admin Credentials

- **Issue**: Admin user creation in seeders had hardcoded email and password
- **Solution**: Now uses environment variables for admin configuration

### 2. Admin Configuration Validation

- **Feature**: Added `validateAdminConfig()` function to validate admin credentials from environment
- **Benefit**: Ensures admin credentials are properly configured before seeding

### 3. Required Admin Environment Variables

```env
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password_here
```

### 4. Admin Security Features

- **Email Validation**: Validates admin email format
- **Environment Validation**: Ensures both email and password are configured
- **Dynamic Username**: Generates username from email prefix
- **Secure Logging**: Only logs email, not password

## Setup Instructions

### Email Service Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in the required email configuration:
   - `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address
   - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail App Password (not your regular password)
3. Ensure your Gmail account has 2FA enabled and generate an App Password for this application

### Admin User Setup

1. Configure admin credentials in `.env`:
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin email address
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Secure admin password
2. Run database seeders to create admin user

### Gmail App Password Setup

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to Google Account Settings > Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
3. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
4. Use this app password as the `EMAIL_PASSWORD` value

- ✅ Clear error messages for missing configuration
- ✅ Fail-fast approach prevents runtime issues
- ✅ Easy to verify email service status
- ✅ Secure admin user management
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
